# ML-Protein-Expression-Research
This repo contains some material from my ML research that was accepted at the Columbia Junior Science Journal (CJSJ).
The copy of the paper uploaded to this repo is a somewhat different version than what was submitted to CJSJ, as CJSJ would own the version I submitted to them.
The paper might be easier to read if you just directly download it. If you choose to read it on GitHub, you will have to press the "More Pages" button at the bottom every 5 pages to be able to see the next 5 pages.
